######## Detailed Explanation ##################################################
The mtx folder only contains files with .mtx extension.

First, an empty folder called roa is crated. All files from mtx are copied into
roa, but their extension is changed to from .mtx to .roa

Next, two csv files (mtxNames.csv and roaNames.csv) are created:

1) mtxNames.csv contains all the file names in the mtx folder, obtained using
   mtx/* but stripped of their extension

2) roaNames.csv contains all the file names in the mtx folder, obtained using
   roa/* but stripped of their extension

The two csv files have the same members, but in slightly different order.
In particular, rows 405 and 406 are swapped, and rows 540 - 561 are permuted
